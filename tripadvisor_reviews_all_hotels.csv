"Domes Miramare, A Luxury Collection ResortIf you own this business, claim it for free now to update business info, respond to reviews, and more.Claim this listing",1,1,,My wife and I spent a week at Domes Miramare in September where we experienced changeable weather as we had 2 days of rain and thunderstorms.We liked the location as the hotel is situated on the beach and the room we stayed had a great sea-view. The hotel is divided in two with one part of the hotel on the other side of a main road which is accessible by an underground walkway. Really glad we did not stay here.Checking in was quick and easy and once done we were then escorted to our room on the first floor and must say the room was very good but found after the first night it was not cleaned everyday and fresh water was not replenished as expected. We had to ask the concierge to get housekeeping to deliver fresh towels etc which is not what you’d expect for a 5star resort.Breakfast was very good as it was a buffet and best of all it had an egg station where you could request your eggs to be cooked anyway you like. The omelettes were excellent.We found the waiting staff to be forgetful as we would ask for tea which arrived ages after our order.The beach has no sand as it is stoney and feels man made which is not easy to walk on - recommend shoes should be worn especially for swimming. We really liked the sea temperature and on days that it did not rain we loved the calm sea.Sun-beds are comfortable and have umbrellas that are great if you need shade. You can order drinks and snacks from your sun-bed but beware of the wait times as it took 45mins to an hour for a waiter to arrive.We were half board so we tried the restaurant “1962” which we looked forward to dining in as the location is excellent right beside the sea but we were disappointed with the menu as the choice of food was not great.We tried the restaurant across the road in the other part of the hotel called Raw which was Mediterranean/Asia. My wife had chicken which was nice and I had Teriyaki Salmon with luke warm rice which was ok. The view over the bay was nice but ruined by the close proximity to the road.We ate out 3 nights in the village nearby and would recommend Tassos as the hosts were very friendly and cooked authentic Greek meals.Overall we would rate the hotel 4stars because of the food choice and poor quality beach surface.,positive

The rooms was spacious with a lovely sea view.Breakfast was a great spread and the staff were super helpful.I agree with other reviewers, water bottles not being refreshed or trash cleared from the room.Overall a relaxing and refreshing stay",positive
"Domes Miramare, A Luxury Collection ResortIf you own this business, claim it for free now to update business info, respond to reviews, and more.Claim this listing",1,3,,"The entire hotel is perfectly air-conditioned. The superior room is beautiful with a wonderful view of the sea and greenery in front of the hotel. It is commendable how much this hotel cares for the environment and how it maintains greenery and flowers. The staff is extremely professional, but at the same time very friendly. Everyone from the maids to the entire restaurant staff who diligently but unobtrusively take away used plates throughout the meal. The reception also deserves all the praise. The employees are very kind and solve everything with a smile so that the guest feels really welcome right from the moment he enters the hotel. The wellness center is excellent. The receptionist at the wellness center is also very kind. It can be seen that this resort is the result of great coordination and hard work of all hotel services.",positive
"Domes Miramare, A Luxury Collection ResortIf you own this business, claim it for free now to update business info, respond to reviews, and more.Claim this listing",1,4,,"This is a lovely hotel with friendly staff and enjoyable food.The hotel and rooms are well appointed, and there certainly is a luxury feel to the hotel.Dinner in the main restaurant was good.Couple of negative things to say, the AC in the rooms are fixed at 23 degrees and cannot be overridden by you. Also, they turn off on a timer through the day and night, so if you don’t like a room to be warm through the night you’ll find yourself being woken by this and having to turn it back on. You can ask for the temperature to be reduced, which I did so twice, but neither time did it happen. On checkout they say it’s ’for the environment’, but in reality we all know it’s to save money, which is not what I’d expect from this grade of hotel given the nightly rates being charged.Regards the sun loungers round the pool and beach, sadly it’s the typical mentality that people get up at the crack of dawn and ‘reserve’ them by placing towels and personal items on them, with no intention of using them until later in the day, if at all. This kind of thing should not be happening and there was no sign of staff monitoring this.Around the pool and beach there was little to no staff either helping with loungers and towels or providing proactive service for drinks or food. So getting anything promptly was a little tricky.When you did interact with staff, they were however very nice and happy to help.Regards the location, there is little to nothing surrounding the hotel, except for a nice little taverna and small supermarket in the adjacent village (5 min walk max).",positive

Bedlinen was lovely and soft. We had no housekeeping issues, and our room was cleaned daily by very friendly staff. We were offered plenty of in room bottled water.We were on a bed and breakfast basis. Breakfast was very varied, and very enjoyable. Coffee did take a little while to arrive, but alternatively, there is a machine where you can get it yourself! It gets busiest at between 10 and 10.30am, so sometimes you have to wait for a table, especially indoors out of the heat. Most of the staff were very chatty and helpful. A smile often helps to get the best out of people.We never had a problem getting a sun lounger. There was a day when there was a towel shortage, but we simply used the ones from our room until more arrived. We didn't make a fuss about it.We had no major issues with service. Yes, it was a bit slow at times, but we ate outside the hotel every night, and service was slow absolutely everywhere! Maybe it's the heat (40deg) or simply a different pace of life.The spa was lovely- I had a very good treatment from the lovely Dora. We were allowed private use of the pool and spa facilities before my massage, which was an unexpected treat.I have never noticed this anywhere in the world before, but the hotel lobby smelt amazing, as did the swanky ladies loo!We used the panoramic pool in the ""new building"" once, but found it very hot up there surrounded by white concrete, and retreated back to the beach for some breeze.It seemed to us that the guests who appeared the most disgruntled were on some form of inclusive food & drink basis, which we weren't.On our last day, a member of staff approached us on the beach to ask if we had any quibbles with our stay. We genuinely had nothing major.We ate out every night at a different restaurant. Notable ones were Caldera (beachfront Moraitika), Rose Garden Gastronomy, Village Taverna and the Tassos Village Grill. Pesce on the main road had great fresh fish.We caught the public bus (air conditioned coach) into Corfu Old Town, which was exceptional value at 2 euros each way.In essence, we had a great stay in the sunshine, and would definitely return.",positive
"Domes Miramare, A Luxury Collection ResortIf you own this business, claim it for free now to update business info, respond to reviews, and more.Claim this listing",1,6,,"Great check in experience, we were shown to our room which was a lovely room but we were really disappointed as we upgraded to a sea view room and overgrown bushes prevented us from the sea view. When we raised the issue we were offered a move however the room wouldn’t be available until 2 days into our holiday.We stayed at the bottom part of the hotel that was a great location by the sea, pool, bar and restaurant. The service was great around the pool and beach, sun loungers always seemed to be available and if they weren’t the staff would address this. The sea was beautiful we are normally pool people but found ourselves sat at the beach everyday.We did room and breakfast and the breakfast was great with a good choice of food and drinks. However service was a bit inconsistent some days you were asked if you wanted hot or cold drinks other days not, all were available for self service tho. Very minor niggle everyday we had to ask for a tea spoon for our hot drink and noticed other guests asking also (there seemed to be a shortage) was a bit annoying everyday having to ask everyday.We were disappointed to find the RAW bar was closed as we were looking forward to having evening drinks and food there as it seemed to be a lovely location and it was advertised online as a place to relax have an evening drink with a nice dj vibe. The restaurant is now located at the top part of the hotel under a different name but not for drinks only.We were also looking forward to having our anniversary dinner in the fine dining restaurant but were told the full menu wasn’t available as it had only just opened, we initially booked but decided to cancel.We asked at reception what was on entertainment wise and was told they wouldn’t know for another few days but each night we seemed to miss out on entertainment as we didn’t know it was on.Harris at reception was great and booked restaurants and taxis for us.Restaurants I’d recommend.Archontiko, beautiful view taxi 25 each way 10 minutesBella vista walking distanceOi Oraies restaurant Benitses (next town) 25 taxi each wayVillage taverna walking distanceRose garden walking distanceI would recommend Corfu old town, we got the green bus 2 euro each way or taxi is 55 euro each way it’s such a beautiful place.We walked along the beach some days for lunch or a drink this is just a 10 minute walk.We also walked up further to the Mesongi river and got a rowing boat over the other side where there are also restaurants and a few bars.Make sure you get up early to catch the sunrise.It seemed the hotel is going through some changes and there are a few teething problems which you would expect to have been resolved before the season started, however we had a great holiday and would defiantly return, we would like to try more of the Domes hotels in the future.",positive
"Domes Miramare, A Luxury Collection ResortIf you own this business, claim it for free now to update business info, respond to reviews, and more.Claim this listing",1,7,,"During my recent 7-night stay at a hotel, I had some disappointments regarding the dining experience. While the hotel had positive aspects, the issues I encountered with the food and service overshadowed the good parts.One major problem I faced was the limited choices on the dinner menu. The options available were quite basic and lacked variety. If you wanted something different, you had to pay extra, which made dining repetitive. This even led my partner to order the same dish multiple times, which was quite underwhelming. On the other hand, guests who didn't opt for the meal plan had more diverse options. This made me feel like I wasn't getting my money's worth from the meal plan I paid for.Furthermore, the lack of free water during dinner service was another letdown. The only water choices were either sparkling or still, both costing an extra €6 per serving. This unexpected expense was disappointing, and it would have been better if they were more upfront about it. This gave me the impression that the hotel was more focused on making money than creating a comfortable experience.The service at the table was also subpar. The supposed complimentary bread and olives took an unusually long 45-50 minutes to arrive before dinner. This was frustrating, especially since the gap between the starter and main course could be over 30 minutes, leaving me hungry. The staff seemed inattentive, and some managers were inconsistent in their greetings and assistance, which made me feel unfairly treated.Despite claiming to provide a luxury experience, the hotel seemed to be cutting corners and saving costs wherever they could. My overall impression of the dining experience was far from positive, and I wouldn't recommend paying for dinner in advance.It was clear that the management team needed better training in handling complaints. I raised my concerns multiple times about the limited menu, added costs, and table service, but they weren't properly addressed. Some managers didn't seem to know how to interact with guests, being selective in their attention. This unequal treatment left a negative impression.In conclusion, although the hotel had its merits, the dining experience was lacking. The limited menu choices, added water costs, inadequate table service, and uneven treatment from some staff members made me feel shortchanged. It's evident that the hotel needs to improve its menu variety, be upfront about extra charges, and enhance its table service. Additionally, staff training is needed to ensure all guests are treated equally and complaints are handled effectively. Until these changes are made, I would advise against prepaying for dinner at this hotel.",positive

This was our 3rd stay at the brand ( previous amazing stays at Domes of Elounda & Domes Noruz both in Crete )The rooms located right on a private beach, gardening having the Olive tree motive, low-key architecture blending with the environment - is excellent, but what made our stay truly outstanding was the level of warm hospitality and personal service from all the staff we interacted with. They really make you feel welcome, know and greet you by name, having a ""can do "" attitude"", and always with a smile.Being return customers at Domes resorts we were delighted to be recognized by familiar faces we remembered from our previous stay at Domes of Elounda. We felt like returning back home which is very pleasant !We stayed on a half board basis which means breakfast: outstanding selection of everything you can think of and dinner: three course meal with ‘dish of the day’ option. Food quality was literally excellent .Again, great staff there especially the manager (forgot to his name, sorry)who is excellent at his job: friendly, welcoming, helpful and remembered us the following day when we bumped into him around the grounds.Our room was very good in a great spot. Literally a 10 second walk to the beach and no bumrush for sun loungers.We have been upgraded since we are repeaters and we are very very grateful for that !A huge THANK YOU to all the staff for their efforts ! ❤️",positive

Impeccable service, stunning sea views, and elegant design create an unforgettable experience. A definition of luxury.The staff at Domes Miramare deserves special recognition. Their friendliness professionalism, warmth, and genuine hospitality left a lasting impression. From the concierge who went above and beyond to recommend local hidden gems to the attentive housekeeping staff who kept our room immaculate, their dedication to guest satisfaction was evident in every interaction.The resort itself was a haven of tranquility and luxury. The beautifully appointed rooms offered breathtaking views of the Mediterranean, and the private beach was a slice of paradise.

We stayed for a luxurious 10 days and felt so relaxed and pampered. The large pool perched high on the hilltop   is spotlessly clean with panoramic views. The sunbeds are plentiful and very comfortable, and the bar service is discreet yet attentive.The breakfast buffet was the highlight of my day: delicious fresh fruit and omelettes made to order; freshly pressed smoothies and plentiful coffee. Evening dinners were elegant and well presented. The quiet location and stunning scenery are breathtaking. All the staff are hardworking, polite, friendly and professional. Special mention must go to Francoise who manages this exquisite hotel so diligently. No problem is too small for her attention and she resolved any issues we had with charm and personal dedication.We can’t wait to return next year to this fabulous hotel.",positive
"Domes Miramare, A Luxury Collection ResortIf you own this business, claim it for free now to update business info, respond to reviews, and more.Claim this listing",2,11,,"Unbelievably beautiful hotel.The entrance and lobby smells absolutely incredible. The staff on arrival are a delight and check in was so easy and simple.Breakfast is probably one of the best I’ve ever been to - everything you could wish for. I preferred going earlier (before 9am) when it’s quietest.There is a small supermarket less than 5 minutes walk away and then a small village with a handful of restaurants and bigger supermarkets about a 10 minute walk away up hill. There are also some lovely beachfront restaurants maybe 5 minutes along (Caldera lounge was particularly great)We had dinner in all 3 of the restaurants, the food in all of them was absolutely sublime. Service was a bit slow in Raw but we are on holiday with no rush to be anywhere so it was not a problem in anyway.There was ample parking for our hire car, and we went out exploring most days - staff at the front of the hotel always extra friendly and making recommendations to us. We were recommended Archontiko restaurant which is maybe a 10minute drive away, it has phenomenal views and a delicious menu - was our favourite meal of the trip.Our room was directly by the pool near the beach which is probably the best location we could have asked for. We preferred the pool nearer the beach as it felt cooler. We also loved watching the sunrise on many mornings.The room was very well air conditioned, beautifully decorated and the bed was ginormous and comfortable.The beach is a pebble beach but this didn’t impact us (it’s actually quite nice not to be covered in sand!) and the water is so clear.All staff were 10/10. Our room was cleaned perfectly every day and we were fully stocked with plenty of water. They allowed us a late checkout which was lovely and enabled us to relax on our last day.We also used the spa and had lovely massages - we also got exclusive use of the facilities beforehand which was such a treat! Highly recommend if you want a few hours out of the sun.",positive
"Domes Miramare, A Luxury Collection ResortIf you own this business, claim it for free now to update business info, respond to reviews, and more.Claim this listing",2,12,,"Basically a nice adults-only resort. We got an upgrade. We had the impression that there was a lack of staff. Most of the breakfast staff worked like crazy, but couldn't keep up with the work because there just weren't enough of them. For my taste, there were too many ants for this type of hotel. The carpet in the room also smelled pretty strong. And then there was the usual occupying of the deck chairs. There are rooms above the street where it is sometimes noisy because of the street, but you have a better view and that's where the bigger pool is. We only had breakfast there and either went into the village or somewhere else to eat because it was just too expensive. We've been to cheaper hotels that were better.",positive
"Domes Miramare, A Luxury Collection ResortIf you own this business, claim it for free now to update business info, respond to reviews, and more.Claim this listing",2,13,,"We arrived at the hotel after check-in time to be told our two sea view emerald rooms were not yet available and that actually they only had of the rooms we had booked available at all for our stay.  A 'upgrade' was offered  of suites in the new hotel block across the road.  The rooms across the road are spacious with sitting area, dressing table, tastefully decorated and well furnished. There is  a generous size bathroom with shower, bath, double sink and separate toilet, Elemis toiletries included.The room had a decent size balcony with two sun loungers and a full size outdoor jacuzzi,  which normally would have been a bonus, but who wants to sit on the balcony or try to relax in a jacuzzi with the view and loud noise of the road below?    You can see the sea, but that is far behind  the driveway, the main road and the main hotel buildings- not an ideal  sea view room.Crossing the road to the main hotel is simply dangerous, many cars and buses are driving too fast,  there is no pedestrian crossing and the road is uneven.The main hotel is set in lovely building, amazing views of the sea, well decorated, always a nice fragrance indoors and cool air con.   The main restaurant is in a beautiful setting across from the sea and has a great selection for breakfast.The beach and beach pool area are is nicely set out with comfortable sun loungers. The beach is shingle, and the sea is crystal clear.   The beach bar and restaurant are very good, in particular they have a delicious range of salads as well as toasted pittas with different dips.During our stay, the occupancy 'across the road' was very small (perhaps 5%)  I can't imagine how the beach area of the hotel would be able to cope with the extended number of guests at high season, as every sun lounger was being used while we were there and already not quite enough for the demand.  I imagine this is a problem waiting to happen.   There is another large outdoor pool 'across the road' but it's simply not as nice as being by the beach.All the hotel staff were friendly and helpful, more than happy to recommend local tavernas or day trips, and wanting to provide the best service possible.In summary, my view is that a very good hotel that is perhaps about to be spoilt by over expansion.  I definitely would not want to stay 'across the road' again, and I would seriously worry about over crowding of the main facilities and beach area if I were a guest in the main hotel in future.",positive
"Domes Miramare, A Luxury Collection ResortIf you own this business, claim it for free now to update business info, respond to reviews, and more.Claim this listing",2,14,,"First and foremost I   want to say all of the staff that we interacted with on the property were very nice and really did seem to care genuinely about the guests and their well being. Alexandra was one that really did shine through from check in to seeing her around the property day in and day out, She was always caring and wanted to know how we were enjoying the island.We came for my husbands birthday and I   did send an email and inform reception up on check in hoping for maybe a small cake or something, this was sadly ignored. Which brings me to my next issue.Apart from that we encountered a lot of issues. First of all the staff enough nice were EXTREMELY disorganized. This was especially noticable in the Restaurant 1962 where we had breakfast every morning. Waiting for a HOT latte instead of a Luke warm one for 20 minutes is simply unacceptable, The staff were always running around and didn't seem to have a lot of training. We also had dinner at the restaurant two nights and the service was terrible considering how outrageous expensive the food is, and the portions and value for your money!  I'd not ever recommending eating there to anyone. Many other restaurants in the area with much better food and service.Next issue was anytime you needed something in your room from maintenance coming to make sure you could lower your air con down from 22 degrees, to getting ice, toiletries, or anything you had to call or text in the app at least two times,and sometimes ended up waiting over two to three hours for what you needed.Housekeeping was also didn't pay great attention to detail. Some times we'd have fully restocked bathroom amenities such as loofahs, and sometimes we couldn't. The floors were dirty as well as the bottom of our feet were black after walking around.All in all, not a five star experience that we were looking forward to! Very sad I   might add!We did submitted a stay concern via the Marriott website, and never heard directly from the hotel,  Just someone from ""customer care"" who thought they were resolving the issue and they of course did not!  We would like to hear directly from the hotel and possibly and email address that we could corrispond with would be wonderful if anyone from the hotel reads this!barefoot in the room. Layers of dust on the lamp shades to other fixtures.My husband is a convoy platinum elite, as well as we had booked our additional two nights though American Express platinum card services which both are suppose to include a 4pm check out. We really only needed about 2 pm and they swiftly told us no!  Not a great way to treat such loyal guests.",positive
"Domes Miramare, A Luxury Collection ResortIf you own this business, claim it for free now to update business info, respond to reviews, and more.Claim this listing",2,15,,"A long awaited holiday and Miramare delivered the relaxation and peace required. The property is beautifully designed and its position at the edge of the sea gives great views  of mainland Greece. The staff were all friendly and willing to help.We do however have a few suggestions that would make the experience better.1. We were guided to what we thought was going to be a sea view room as per our booking and when we opened the door we immediately felt let down as we would be getting a view of a ramp to the first floor rooms. The customer relations manager did however sort as soon as possible and we were given a beautiful room on the first floor with view s over the olive trees to the sea. The first room should not have been offered as it did put the mood of the first day down a little.2. The breakfast area is a great place to start the day and the choice is endless. However the ""hot "" items were one notch above cold and one notch below tepid. This is not appealing and especially so with eggs benedict  that have wobbly whites and cold yolks.3. The hotel needs to take a stand on the way that beds are reserved at the pool by clients that should know better. One morning I watched as someone put their towels on beds at 08.30 and did not return until 11.00. The pool area is small for the size of the hotel and reserving beds is very selfish and rude. The size of the pool is not an issue as there are plenty of beds at the beach. but while we were there there was an unusual visitation of a large number of jellyfish and the pool seemed the more sensible idea. One small housekeeping issue on the beach - All beds should have cushions not just half of them - looks untidy. The boys who looked after this area did a great job and special mention should go to Musa who was friendly and efficient.As other reviewers have commented  if the newly opened sister hotel across the road is allowed to use the beach and pool the calm atmosphere  could change for the worse overnightWe would also rate Raw Bar - The sushi was fantastic and great value for money.Overall a great stay with a few niggles.",positive
"Domes Miramare, A Luxury Collection ResortIf you own this business, claim it for free now to update business info, respond to reviews, and more.Claim this listing",2,16,,"In most respects a good hotel but one or two flaws. We were in the newer building so lots of stairs or lifts. There is an underpass so you can avoid crossing a busy road to go from one part to another (e.g. the room to breakfast). Supposedly there to avoid risk from the traffic but introduced the new risk of slipping on the washed stone stairs! Breakfast had a wide range of food, mostly good, but, IMO, they did not pay much, if any, attention to serving the food that was supposed to be hot much above tepid. The same applied to the coffee on several mornings.  We sat outside and at one end the staff were very helpful and brought things straight away and cleared tables quickly. At the other end a rather depressed man paid little attention to us. and seemed to resent being on duty at all. The poolside in the newer building was comfortable never overcrowded and the staff were very helpful , efficient and welcoming. We ate in their restaurants. The most expensive (the Makris) was excellent and the only eating place that conquered the wasps! The Asian/Mediterranean was a little cheaper and served some interesting dishes that were well done and the service was very good. The 1962 was not as good and the main problem with it was not the food but the service which seemed friendly but quite slapdash at times. When one of our starters was attacked by wasps they recognised the problem but just wouldn't do anything effective about it. Eventually I crossed the dish off the bill(it had been ruined) and that was accepted with reasonable grace. I enjoyed the fortnight there but I am not sure I would rush back.",positive

On both occasions we stayed in a Pavilion Retreat sea view room with a private deck and hot tub and we were half board with access to the Haute living room.For the most part we had an amazing time. Service is excellent across the board, rooms are clean and well maintained, food is excellent quality and the grounds are beautifully kept.However, we had a few niggles which I think the hotel should address. Firstly, we arrived on Friday, which is BBQ night in the 1962 restaurant (we were not aware of this prior to arriving).  We were half board but the only dining options were to participate in the BBQ for an extra fifty euros per person or eat from the vegan menu.  My partner had to had BBQ (which was not worth an extra fifty euros) and, as I'm vegetarian, I was forced to eat vegan.  Although the hotel offered us 30 mins complimentary spa access it wasn't really enough to compensate for a disappointing meal.We booked both Korypho and Makris restaurants. Korypho offered very little vegetarian choice and I was given a bland risotto so I cannot recommend this. Makris offered NO vegetarian menu which made for a very awkward situation for us, the poor kitchen and the waiting staff. The hotel went out of their way to rectify this but be aware of this (I assumed since I'd made my dietary requirements known to them, this wouldn't be an issue)The Haute living room offers snacks throughout the day but I found I was not catered for. One day there was nothing vegetarian for me to eat and a request to the kitchen by our living room host was ignored. Furthermore, the food is not labelled  correctly and although I spoke to reception about this, nothing changed. On one occasion I put a forkful of potato salad in my mouth and found it had tiny bits of bacon in.The only last point is regarding the toiletries in the room. Last year these were Byredo Le Chemin (which is made for the Luxury Hotel Group) so I was looking forward to using these. However, it seems Miramare have kept the Byredo bottles and are refilling them with an inferior product. I tried to speak to reception about this but nothing happened. It is ridiculous to put products in a room without guests being aware of the ingredients and it seems like a way to dupe guests into thinking they are being provided with a luxurious product when they are not.I really hope the hotel takes these points into consideration. We would love to return again next year.",negative

This building lacked atmosphere, there wasn’t a person to be seen and I didn’t feel comfortable to be staying here. I was informed that there were no rooms available in the main building,  I insisted that as far as I was concerned our booking was for the main building, Finally after much deliberation we were given a great room for the whole week in the main building.  The management team treated us like royalty,  Thank you all ,  much appreciated.The food in the buffet is of an excellent standard and the staff are attentive and very professional, pool area is spotless with plenty of bed’s available here and on the beach.

Again, plenty of vegan options were there and I’m sure more could have been offered had we asked.The seafront is lovely and if you reach early enough sun beds are available. If not, the staff will grab one for you. The pool area can be a little crowded however.The general atmosphere is very calm and quiet, perfect for us who wanted to relax after a busy work life back home.There is a wonderful gym and spa area across the road which is perfectly maintained and smells incredible!The nearby town of Moraitika has some nice restaurants (Edesma in particular) which have great Greek food in vegan form eg moussaka, keftedakia. Staff are great there. Also a couple of very nice bars whose drinks are significantly cheaper than in the hotel!Hotel has a few activities during the week, ask for a schedule. We did a painting class with Spiros Gelekas overlooking the water which was wonderful! Highly recommend.A couple of negatives which we think could be improved upon:- Over the course of the week there was a smell of sewage in the bathroom coming from a drain next to the toilet. I’ve noted this in a previous review too. Think the plumbing needs some work.- The price of some of the souvenirs in the lobby is prohibitively expensive. For example, a bottle of olive oil from Governers costs 63eu, whilst if you go to the tour 15 mins away (corfiot oil experience) the same bottle costs 25eu. Crazy mark up.On the whole however, a brilliant experience made special by the stunning decor, location and the exceptional staff. Particular thanks to Milka and Musa who are both so friendly and attentive :)",positive

Greek plumbing failed on one occasion but was quickly corrected. Both pool areas were lovely. The beach was a mix of sand and shingle and was kept tidy by attentive pool staff . We stayed B and B . The breakfast was excellent with every taste catered for and a choice of sitting inside or outWe visited several good local tavernas and enjoyed the surrounding area,positive

From the moment of arrival to stepping into the taxi to leave, staff were always on hand to suggest whatever would make for the best holiday experience.Ours was a four night stay in pavilion retreat accommodation with a jacuzzi, huge terrace and grassy path down to the sea. Irini, the manager of the area is exceptionally hard-working and wanted to ensure that everything was perfect for our stay. We had a lovely light, spacious room and the well-equipped bathroom was enormous. We really appreciated the room service with regular changing of linens and towels. There was never a shortage of anything.We really appreciated Haute Living lounge and terrace overlooking the sea, where there was a super range of snacks, canapés and hot food available, as well as drinks. The service there, as throughout the hotel, was excellent.As the website shows the setting for the hotel is magnificent with beautifully kept lawns, gardens, spotlessly clean paths and grassy areas right next to the sea. It was  beautiful. In April an attractive heated swimming was much appreciated.Food: the breakfast was buffet style where eggs could be freshly prepared and there was a great range of food to suit every taste. At dinner we were on half-board so we used the table d’hote menu which was excellent. The starters and main courses changed every day so there was no problem with choice. Everything was exquisitely presented and delicious to eat. Out of interest we looked at the a la carte menu which was very expensive, but it wasn’t necessary as the dishes we had were all of the highest quality.Some hotels make claims that they have paid attention to aesthetics but more often than not, they disappoint. However this is not the case at Domes Miramare. Even the books available to peruse throughout the public area of the hotel, mainly on design, were of the highest quality and interest.All the staff worked very hard but we want to express particular appreciation of Irini (Villa manager,) Nadia (Concierge) and Maria (in the restaurant.)Highly recommend this hotel for a peaceful retreat.",positive

I raised concerns not dissimilar to those I have since read on Trip Advisor this evening (so i will not repeat them) and it would appear they do not truly care. Sad as it’s a lovely facility. I had to laugh about the pool side comments. I watched the lifeguard pay more attention to a dog than she did guests. While most of the staff were extremely professional, many were sloppy. I had to point out I had not been charged for the trip into the old town and to be honest maybe I should not have paid as I don't understand why we were ferried out  (10 of us in a Maybach Van - I had to sit in front as I am claustrophobic) at 18:30 on a Sunday when most of the shops were closed and it was dark ??? In response to my ""complaint"" I got a curt, sorry you feel that way, food beverage and a ""I look forward to your review"". To be honest if i could have left I would have.

Beachfront rooms do not have interconnecting rooms!!Eventually we were moved to a ground floor room which was more acceptableI felt we were being duped and it left a sour taste not what you want at the start of your holidayHousekeeping left a lot to be desired bear minimum at best glasses left dirty wine glasses not replaced only bathroom floor cleanedI will not be returning,positive

Before to commence detailing the reasons of this low rating review i would like to mention the below things :Last summer my wife made a booking at Domes Of  Elounda in Crete island which is also a part of Marriot Bonvoy. I have to say that everything were perfect every detail was great, a real luxury hotel nothing similar with domes miramare in corfu.First, our pillows and bedsheets we recognize that for some reason were dirty, we discover that at the corners they had some kind of yellow spots. Furthermore we believe that the quality of the hotels restaurant products was moderate and not perfect, while the tastes were contested. One really good thing was the design of the hotel while the combination of the green inside the building and main olive tree were very beautiful and one second good thing was the suggestion of Archontiko restaurant. Lastly for me and my wife the most important thing is the trust between the customers and the hotels staff. Me and my wife in every island that we visit, we love to make roundtrips and visit places. So for this reason we asked from the receptionist team to book us a high quality  transportation for Corfu town. In that part we didn't expect that our transportation after 30 minutes of waiting will be carried out by a conventional  low quality black Renault car. More specifically we didn't expect that a Marriot hotel  cooperates with low quality vehicles. Our driver was acting like amateur without professionalism, during our transport the driver was asking a lot of questions and for some reason never stops talking.  The conversation during the transportation must not exceed the limits of talking, the driver has to understand when to stops. Finally when we arrived at Corfu town our driver insisted to book with him our return back and we answered that we will call to the hotel to organize our return. Unfortunately the hotel send us the same Renault car and driver while we asked again for a high quality transport.  I want to underline, that we are not the kind of personalities which make all the time complaints to the staff and the managers because ,wrongly  we believed that we spend a really big amount and we thought that the hotel would be on the same standards as Elounda in Crete.",positive

Eventually the helpful customer relations manager Christopher moved us to a suite which was lovely.However even in that room, the cleaning staff did not wash the cups/glasses at night, not a 5 star turn down service.The only restaurant lacked any atmosphere and food was only average at ridiculous prices.

We were greeted at reception with a lovely cold local drink by our host and manager for the week Christoforos. He was such a delighted gentleman, who was always on hand to answer questions and offer his advice, and truly looked after our every need for the whole duration. Well done Christoforos! He has booked our evening dinner reservation, which allowed to enjoy the gastronomic delights of the a la carte menus that evening. This are bordering on Michelin star standards and presented beautifully on every occasion. We were half boarders, and therefore able to sample most of the menu during the week and also to be able to choose from the menu of the day which changed every day. The Snickers dessert was amazing and is a must to try.Breakfast was buffet style and hot drinks could be ordered with your waiter, or self serve, choice to suit you. The range of food available was vast, and incredibly freshly delivered. Nothing was too much trouble and if something wasn’t displayed that you fancied, then all you had to do was ask, the staff were very accommodating.We also had the delight to be introduced to Marena, the Operations Manager, who again was so helpful and understanding. She was always on hand and available and incredibly visitor friendly to ensure everybody’s stay was as memorable as possible. She is a true ambassador for the company and was never afraid to lend a helping hand to all her staff when required and listened to her visitors. Both Marena and Christoforos are real assets to this hotel and business and should be commended for all their hard work and caring attitude.The hotel was extremely clean and comfortable, the rooms were of a good size, the beds were luxurious and toiletries were of the highest quality. Food was incredible and we ate at the Japanese restaurant on a couple of occasions, again which was of the highest quality. Evening entertainment was great, and could be heard whilst dining if you want to have a later evening dinner. We enjoyed the Haute Living concept and experience.I would recommend this hotel highly, and particularly if you wish to have a quiet relaxing time and be amongst other adults given this is an adults ( 18 year old +) only resort and hotel.Well done Marena, keep up the good standards and hope to see you all again soon.",positive

The location on the beach is stunning with plenty of space with peace and quiet. We had a very comfortable room with a good view across the lawns to the beach 40 yards away.Other reviews have mentioned the offer of an upgrade to the hotel across the road and guess what……we were offered an upgrade when we checked in (we had booked through Tui)! Sounded great, larger room in the newly refurbished hotel block but it wasn’t until we were escorted across the busy road that we began to feel we had been conned. Yes, the room was very large with a jacuzzi on the balcony (from which you could just see the sea 200 yards away) but the road noise and the constant loud music around the pool was not what we had booked…….we had booked a beachside room.That evening we spoke with the receptionist who straightaway said she would try to move us back to the main hotel and the following morning we were very happy to accept a delightful room. They were most helpful but I suspect they must tire of similar requests. Just be honest with guests by saying that the upgrade is without sea view.

Also heard other guests complaining about the poor choice and quality.There are also a few pastries, but as mentioned before poor allergy information provided.Beers, soft drinks and wine also provided for those interested.We use the panoramic pool which has one toilet cubicle with a door that doesn’t close on the female side.Courtesy bus Tuesday and Friday to Corfu old town which is worth a visit as not much around the hotel.Won’t be returning.

Certainly would suggest avoiding booking the panoramic part of the hotel especially if you are elderly or less mobile. I travelled with my elderly mother and felt isolated as the small walk to the new lift between the two parts of the hotel is difficult. Further we were unable to use the pool as again the access was via stairs only. Generally the hotel previously was of a very high standard, but now is in need of  renovation. The staff are now a lot younger and inexperienced, only a few seem to go that extra mile.On this occasion we had booked HB but be warned for a bottle of water you are charged an extranet amount of 6 euros. In Corfu Town itself expect to pay around 2 Euros. In the local supermarkets you can pick up a large 2 litre bottle up for 0.40 euros. There are plenty of local travens  be it a short distance walk away.If I do decide to revisit will definitely avoid booking this side of the hotel. I did try and request a change of room but the request fall on deaf ears which was disappointing. Although a buggy service was suggested for my mother it didn’t help to get her to the pool area.I hope this review enables helps others and ensures that they enjoy their experience as I had done previously.",positive

We will return, this was our first visit.  This hotel is 5* plus.  Standards of cleanliness, hygenie and covid secure considerations are extreemly highly.I would advise taking a pair of beach/water shoes, the beach is gravelly as is the entrance to the sea, the water is crystal clear, clean and the slope into the sea means you can walk a long way out before the water is deep.The hotel breakfast is sublime, something for everyone.  The poolside bar has a more informal menu and the main restaurant in the evening, whilst a little on the expensive side is still great, and expertly cooked and presented.  The concerige are happy to recommend local restaurants outside of the hotel, use them - for insider knowledge beyond trip advisor recommendations.  All recommendations were good.Stepping outside the hotel - the local village is not exceptional, more functional, with a reasonable pizza place, one smarter bar, two taverners in the old village and one gourmet restaurant, and  a number of functional bars and restaurants of no note at all. Local recommended restaurants are within walking distance or the hotel will arrange a taxi.  Further restaurants are avaliable within a short taxi ride.  NB taxi's are slightly on the expensive side.Corfu town is worth spending time, and perhaps an evening shopping and eating. 30 mins away.We used the Corfu green line bus, but also Messonghi travel (in the village outside the hotel, at the far end of the village from the hotel),  for an whole island tour and evening coach trips into Corfu Town.

There are lots of good restaurants in Moraitika and Messonghi so do try them out. Much cheaper with better and friendlier service.The cleanliness is debatable as the public areas are not being swept. There are bits of rubbish in certain areas that had been there for days. I dropped some feta cheese in the restaurant one morning which l forgot to pick up and it was still there the next morning. Our room is clean enough but no one has cleaned the jacuzzi in the week we had been there  as it was full of insects. An empty bottle of wine in a cooler sat in our room for a few days.The Panoroma pools and sun beds are lovely. However do not arrive early as at  well past 10 in the mornings there are no pool towels out. Umbrellas still not up. Pool bar not open until much later. You get one free water but then are asked to pay for any more. Think the hotel is having a laugh with the prices they are charging. Why is there not a free water dispenser on the bar. To be fair, there is lots of water provided in the room.Door in ladies toilet by the pool does not close properly and there is no outside shower by the pool.

However it has major issues regarding customer service particularly around the restaurants, bars and haute living, minor gripes first regarding the room, no cups for the coffee machine, beautiful white sofa covered in dirty marks, shower door that won't stay closed and no sun loungers or umbrella on arrival had to ask for these.We booked this hotel due to the fact it offers three different styles of restaurants, we paid to have a dine around package, however on check we were told that the Makirs restaurant would not be open until 12/5, this is after we return home.  The two remaining restaurants, one being the Raw was offering a very limited menu which only included sushi and fish dishes, differing from the menu on the hotels website, this left us with only one restaurant the 1962 which offered us the same menu every single night for the week we were there, again a very limited menu selection.As mentioned on previous reviews the restaurant has some serious staff issues.  One particular night we waited half and hour to be told the wine we chose was not available, we then choose another bottle and waited for another 45mins before this arrived, by the time the wine arrived we had already had our starters!  After two hours of waiting for plates to be cleared and mains to arrive we decided not to wait any longer and left the restaurant, at no point during this time were we told of any technical issues.  If this is the case what's wrong with the old fashioned pen and paper and customer communication.Breakfast, the food was always luke warm and ordering and receiving a cup of coffee was hit and miss.  If you were lucky enough to get your coffee which again was warm, ordering a second cup was not an option.Haute Living - apart from the fact that this is in a separate building across the main road, again was not worth having.  The first day we went across around 13.30hrs and there was lovely spread of food and wine and beer to chose from.  However the next day again around 1345hrs and for the rest of the week, there was no food, no white wine, when a member of staff was asked where food was she didn't know.  However when pushed the food arrived around 1415hrs, as did the wine and beer.  This is meant to be exclusive to guests that have paid to have this option available and should have hot and cold food available though out the day.As a summary, this week here was not worth the money paid as the hotel has not delivered what was expected.  Apologies from senior staff on the last day, and an explanation of how they are going to rectify it moving forwards, is not going to help the guests who's holiday has now finished!",negative

Firstly, location. It's about 35mins from the airport (50 euros one way) and outside a small town. It's not the best location from a surrounding area perspective, but it is also by the beach which is incredible. Being able to very easily get to the water's edge is brilliant and the views across the sea towards mainland Greece are amazing. There are a few very nice restaurants in the local town (recommend Village Taverna and Bella Vista) along with some useful local stores.The staff were amazing, really friendly, helpful, polite, professional, all positive. Can't say anything more about them, they were great.The room was pretty nice, nicely decorated, clean and well furnished although lacking some personality. But obviously, the views out to the sea (for sea view rooms) makes up for this. I will echo what one previous reviewer said about road noise, but it does depend on which room you're in. I couldn't hear road noise at night when our windows/doors were closed but obviously won't be the case for everyone.The main hotel building, lobby and reception area are really nicely decorated, lots of plants and flowers and beautiful olive tree in the middle. On most days during the morning and/or evening, there's musical entertainment which is a really nice touch and adds to the experience.Dinner at Makris was decent if you're into fine dining, but it's expensive for what it is. I'd recommend going to the local tavernas for a more authentic, and less expensive, experience. The hotel also lets you book their speedboat to go into Corfu Town but we found it extortionate at 150 euros one way. The bus is 5 euros return and is probably takes a similar time.Overall, we had a really lovely stay. The location by the beach was brilliant, staff were really nice and the overall atmosphere and vibe of the place was nice (although hotels like this attract a certain type of guest). However, we wouldn't come back anytime soon, not at this price. It was a nice luxury experience, a one-off.",positive

As a starter, service at the bar for an aperitif was not good. Despite an almost empty bar, we first waited about 15 minutes before we had to go inside and ask if we could order. Then finally, a waitress came out to take our orders. Yet to pay the bill, it was again a struggle to get anyone's attention. In the restaurant, we then felt that almost all the sommeliere's recommendations were about pricey bottles (70€ and up). Moreover, after the main course, we were basically just ignored by our waitress altogether - I am not sure why, but we felt they wanted to call it a day and get rid of guests. Ultimately, to pay, we again had to walk inside because we would not get anyone's attention otherwise.In sum, our experience was not as luxurious as we expected and certainly not as in other Marriott's luxury category hotels we visited. Given the price, the service is simply not up to standards. This seems to be an ongoing weakness that other guests have noted already, and we fully concur. In contrast, we did not have any such issues at our hotel (Marbella Nido), so the Domes Miramare is no longer an option for our next stay in Corfu.As a side note: Both the bar and the restaurant refused to record my Marriott Bonvoy points. Although the hotel participates in the program and I am a Gold Elite member, we were told that this was not possible unless we had a room reservation. I have never experienced this in any Marriott hotel, and I find it unacceptable.",negative

Christopher was incredibly welcoming and responded to all our queries so professionally.Also special thanks to Xenofon who assisted us with booking transports and boat trips through our stay.The one issue we had was sorted out quickly with minimum of fuss and if all hotels had a Christopher there would be much happier guests !We will definitely be back !",positive

From the moment we entered the hotel we were treated with warmth and courtesy by Petros and every other staff member we encountered. The beach front rooms were a 2 minute, slow walk  to the small pebble shore that turned into sand once you entered the water. The beach lounges were comfortable and plentiful. If you stay in part of the hotel that is across the street, you will be able to take a quick walk to an elevator (or stairs) to a short, well lit tunnel that takes you under the street to the beachfront part of the hotel. However, the huge pool across the street has such a breathtaking, panoramic view of the sea, that you may prefer to spend your time sipping cocktails on the thick, luxurious loungers there instead of coming down to the beach. Servers like Miltiades and the lovely manager of the beachfront restaurant provided us with warm hospitality and made us feel at home. The daily breakfasts were delicious and decadent. Kudos to the general manager for creating an atmosphere of true philoxenia, or love and respect of the stranger, among her staff. I highly suggest scheduling a 1 day speedboat trip to Paxos & Antipaxos on Trident Speedboat Cruises on Kavos, and taking the hotel shuttle to the old town of Corfu.

The rooms were great, the staff were very friendly and welcoming. The main lobby features different musicians which was a lovely touch. The beach was good and the pools were cooler but still great for our 5-day trip.We were on a half board package which meant we could have breakfast and either a dinner or a lunch. The breakfast was great, with everything you'd want/expect from a premium hotel. There are three restaurants for dinner - the main breakfast restaurant turns in to a sit down service, there is an Asian restaurant and a tasting menu restaurant (we didn't go to this one). Our tip is to request two starters rather than have the dessert, that way you can make the most of the best course. The mains typically don't come with any side dishes, and we found some menu options a little bland. We went back to the Asian restaurant and on the last night had the best dinner of the holiday (2 starters of tuna, sashimi and nigiri).We went off-site for two meals and found the nearby The Village Tavern a great/authentic choice.

Going in to town was €55 each way, which adds up very quickly. If you have mobility problems make sure they don't put you in the upper building.  That building has amazing views but getting back and forth to the main property was challenging.  They have elevators to help but while I was there 1 elevator was broken and climbing those stairs to go back and forth was painful.The staff is very nice, but as others have mentioned, no one is really in a rush to do anything for you.  I had dinner in 1962 one night - food was very good, but like others mentioned, once you get your food, the staff forgets you're there. It took well over 90 mins for 1 entree and 1 dessert - no starters or anything.I only had housekeeping 1 day and all they did was make the bed.  I expected the glasses to be replaced with clean ones as I had used the others for soda, but they left the dirty glasses in the room, so I washed them.I went with a friend who picked the hotel - if I went back I would choose something closer to town.

There are of course boat trips and water activities if you want them. We took an all day boat trip to mainland Greece, swam in the Blue Lagoon, stopped at a small bar on the way back.The area of Moraitika / Mesongi isn’t huge but has everything you need there. We took a tour around Corfu and this area definitely more traditional than some of the other tourist type resorts.The hotel itself is some 150 rooms suites and villas split across two areas, waterside and panoramic, each with a different feel. Upstairs is very modern with a large chill out pool. There have been some minor improvements since our last visit, like changes to menus. Its lovely that evening meals are served to the table not the usual buffet style. All the staff are friendly and work really hard. Too many to mention by name but it was lovely to see so many familiar faces still working there. Our favourite change was the call buttons for service on the beach.We were on the Half Board Dine Around option. Food is amazing with both a standard menu and daily specials menu in the main restaurant, an option to dine at the Asian and Fine Dining restaurants and a complimentary lunch all included.Our tour round the island showed us other resorts and hotels.

However, upon check-in we were shown to a room that not only was directly on the pool (zero privacy & loud) but also backed up to the road so we fell asleep and woke up to the sound of the cars each day...to make matters worse, on top of the noise and lack of privacy the bathroom was completely unsafe and unsanitary. It smelled of sewage every single day and the shower door was not sealed properly so it flooded the bathroom each time we showered creating a severe risk of falling and injuring ourselves.We brought each of these items up to the concierge, receptionist and ""guest relations"" staff and asked to switch rooms (no less than five times), and each time we were told they would ""look into it"". For a supposedly five star resort, in the Luxury Collection with Marriott - this is completely unacceptable, especially since the resort was not sold out for the dates of our stay. At the very least, we could have been offered a free dinner, spa treatment or points to make up for the absolute lack of room quality and safety but all of our concerns were ignored.I am sad to say that we will never return to this resort and cannot recommend to anyone either.

Despite our stay during the Christmas and New Year holidays, with very crowded streets, we could not perceive any noise, at least from our floor (eighth of twenty)Body wash, hand soap and shampoo brought to the room only on the penultimate day (we thought they were not included and we adapted accordingly).Good cleaning, even by Italian standards, but rooms tidied up every other day (we had to ask for supplements more than once, at least for towels).Breakfast (included for us, paid an exorbitant price) is served in a room connected to the Hotel (accessible both from the street and from the Hotel Hall): it is not a continental breakfast, but à la carte, with typical breakfast dishes American. Personally, I didn't mind it (the bagels with smoked salmon were excellent), but I understand that it's not for all palates (the dessert offering is very limited); furthermore, out of 9 days only 3 days it was possible to have cappuccino or foamed milk (loved by my daughter), because the other days the machine was broken. In the end it is certainly more convenient to choose one of the thousand places on the fifth or sixth.As in all American hotels, they block a credit card deposit of around 100 dollars per day, as a guarantee.

Around the corner from the hotel is the subway station on 34th which will help you travel in New York with great ease.

The Empire State building and Macys are both just one block away. The central located Time Square is just a few minute walk and easily accessible via Broadway. If I have to mention a downside (which we didn’t really experienced) it is the price-quality ratio, for the money we would have at least expected any kind of breakfast, but it did not spoil our enjoyment. There are plenty places on the street that you can choose and it gives you the  advantage not being tied to early morning wake-up, which is useful because you have to get used to the time difference during the first few days when you come from Europe.

We were given a quilted blanket (with no cover) and one pillow for my sons to use (I gave my other son a pillow from my bed. There were no facecloths (my husband asked for them as they were shown in one of the photos) but we were told there weren’t any (these did actually come when the maid serviced our room!) We left for the first day’s sightseeing and on our return at 5pm the room had not been serviced.

There was no noise at night and aircon worked fine, so you can get a good night's sleep before you have to go out and experience the city.We hadn't purchased breakfast at the hotel, but there are plenty of good deli's in the area where you can buy breakfast at a reasonable Award. So the coffee machine in the room is a plus.The hotel is in a nice area, close to Macy's and Herald Sq. metro so it's easy to get around the city.  In addition, many sights are within walking distance.We would love to stay again at Hotel Le Soleil if the trip again goes to NYC.",positive
"Executive Hotel Le Soleil New YorkIf you own this business, claim it for free now to update business info, respond to reviews, and more.Claim this listing",2,19,,"The hotel was warm, cosy and friendly. It's in a fantastic location - 5 min walk to the Empire State, maybe 10 mins to Summit 1 and a subway station a few mins away that took us all the way to Central Park and the American Natural History Museum. Time Square is maybe 15 mins walk. There are bars, restaurants and shops just a few minutes walk away and they're all open pretty late. We loved Dawson 39, The Kegg and The Best Sichuan.Our first room on the 7th floor was big with a sofa area but the view was onto the back of an appt block and not very inspiring so we asked if we could change. The reception were very helpful and gave us the key of a room on the 18th to view. It was smaller but so much nicer! We could see the Empire state from our bedroom (and shower!). The bed was so comfy and was made up every morning. We even had a little kitchenette so we could make Tea in the morning with the kettle we were provided with.There is a lovely lounge with a fire downstairs, an attendant who opens the front door and helps with any questions. The only thing this hotel would benefit from would be a little bar or something so you could get a drink in the lounge - maybe there was a way to do this and we just didn't find it (there was a nice looking restaurant attached but it always looked closed/empty).  This didn't bother us at all though and we had a fabulous stay here. We loved the cucumber/orange water in the lobby, coming back to a warm place when the snow fell and sleeping really really well! Thank you all. We would absolutely recommend.",positive

The rooms are just stunningly spacious for a family - it’s set out nicely that you feel like you even have seperate areas which is hard to come by - double sofa bed, comfy too and had its own TV that end! We had a wonderful hotel room with views of the Empire State Building which was just fab! The location is fantastic and actually it feels a bit quieter because you’re off on a side street. It’s a real HIDDEN GEM. And I’d 100% book this hotel if we came to stay again - especially as a family. I especially loved the touch of free infused water, coffee and even hot chocolate and marshmallows in the lobby every day - what a lovely touch. The maid service is fantastic too. Couldn’t fault it.

All at a price point which is very reasonable for NYC.- We booked an Executive King room.  Arrived, were allocated a 4th floor room, which was just fine - cosy in size, but perfectly functional, quiet, clean, etc.,...  Except for a temperamental safe that kept failing to lock.  Reception was very responsive and sent up maintenance person to fix.  Turned out the fix was not permanent, despite the efforts of three (helpful and professional) maintenance visits, so the next day I asked to speak to a manager as it was becoming a real pain, having to hang around every time we opened and closed safe.  The manager on duty, Joe, was great.  There were no Executive King rooms available, but after some effort, he showed me a couple of options, including a room on a higher floor that was larger but with a queen bed.  He (correctly) reassured me that it would be quiet despite being near the elevators, and we moved up for an excellent experience for the balance of our stay.All the staff, from Jamie at front door, to reception, to Joe and Mo (Operations Director) were very friendly and helpful - it felt it was the culture of the place.Location wise, excellent - very central, close to subway, yet very quiet, having experienced both a street-facing 4th floor room and a back-facing 17th floor room (with great view of Empire State Building).Will definitely stay here if back in NYC.",positive
"Executive Hotel Le Soleil New YorkIf you own this business, claim it for free now to update business info, respond to reviews, and more.Claim this listing",3,22,,"On the last night of our stay (Saturday, 12/2--which coincidentally was my birthday) at around 8pm, a member of housekeeping burst into our room during the most private time a couple can share. It was absolutely humiliating. There was music playing and it had to have been obvious from outside that the room was occupied. When I put on a robe and went out into the hall to find out what was so important that she had to enter the room without permission she didn't even apologize.The problems with The Executive started when we got to the original room on Thursday 11/30. First and foremost, the room was insulting for the price point, but more importantly, looking around there were small holes in the ceiling and it just did not have the feel being worth anywhere near what we were spending. Within minutes I also found a hole in the frame of the window and cold air from the street was pouring into the room. I called down to the front desk and they were accommodating and moved us to a suite on a low floor for no additional charge.On Saturday we tried the restaurant Trademark that's part of the hotel for brunch. It was one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant. Our server was completely overwhelmed and verging on hostile to us, other guests and the staff. I ordered the 'Eggs in Hell' and it was one of the worst dishes I've ever been served at a restaurant. I sent it back for the bacon egg and cheese croissant. The only saving grace of the meal was the manager that came in around 1pm who tried her best to turn things around for us. We didn't have to see the original server again and to her credit she really made the remainder of the meal excellent for us. Unfortunately, it was too late to salvage the visit and I wouldn't ever come back to the restaurant.But all pales in comparison to what I described above. Housekeeping just bursting into the room after 8pm on a Saturday night at the absolute worst possible moment and then not even apologizing. If anything she seemed put out by the experience, herself.I worked with Nico at the front desk who, to his credit, did his best in a terrible situation. We were somewhat compensated for what happened but it was ugly enough that compounded with everything else made me just want to go home. It ruined the rest of the night and the trip. Absolutely do not recommend.",negative

This will be the hotel I'll stay at when I'm next in NYC.,positive
Casablanca Hotel By Library Hotel Collection,1,2,,"Our room was small, but well appointed.  The breakfast/snack room is a charmer, and the staff is uniformly warm and welcoming.  The place is a jewel box. The location can’t be beat - five steps from 7th Ave on 43rd st, right up the block from Town Hall, and less than five minutes walk to any broadway theater.",positive
Casablanca Hotel By Library Hotel Collection,1,3,,"Best hotel in New York in my opinion.   The location is literally 15 metres from Times Square, the first floor lounge area offers seating, and a good breakfast of bagels, buns, eggs, and drinks and snacks available throughout the day and night.  The rooms were spacious, clean and serviced every day by the maid.  The staff were very welcoming and friendly.Tip try to get a room not facing the roadside as refuse collection vehicles for other establishment visit each night about 3am, with their reserving sirens aloud.",positive
Casablanca Hotel By Library Hotel Collection,1,4,,"Coming back to this hotel every night after the hustle and bustle of New York at Christmas time felt like coming home. A true oasis - calm, friendly, small and quiet. The lounge on the 2nd floor was a godsend,  meaning we could always grab a coffee or a piece of fruit or pastry, any time. The room was very comfortable (we had an inside room so I guess the only small thing was not having any outside view at all to see if it was raining). This location meant we could see all of the Christmassy things in New York within easy walking distance, and there are subway stations very close by entering further afield.",positive
Casablanca Hotel By Library Hotel Collection,1,5,,"This is a remarkably pleasant refuge in the busy Times Square location.Once inside the hotel, it is quiet and the staff very welcoming. The rooms are not large; our Premium room had just enough room for a 3-drawer chest and a small table with a chair. We were extremely comfortable here, and the staff were very responsive to our needs. When we had minor difficulties and called down, they came very quickly and solved the problem.The lounge was on the 2nd floor, and was a very comfortable place to gather. We were a family of 4 adults, and we frequently would gather there for meals, snacks or just to talk.This is on one of the most crowded streets I've ever experienced. It is very slow for taxis to get into and out of this part of 43rd street, so that is a disadvantage if you want to travel in that way.Although the hotel is flanked by 2 restaurants, we found them to be so busy that tables were nearly unattainable. This may have been due to the season. We ate some take-out in the lounge, and had planned a number of meals elsewhere when we were going out anyway. Of course very pleasant continental breakfast (included in the cost of the room) was available in the lounge every morning.",positive
Casablanca Hotel By Library Hotel Collection,1,6,,"This was the first time we had stayed here and had a really awesome experience. We normally stay in Hilton properties with our family but the one in NYC was under construction this time. The Casablanca has so much more going for it, so this is where we will be staying in the future.The first difference is the service culture displayed by the excellent staff. James at check-in, and John on the door and evenings were particularly pleasant. The ladies serving breakfast and housekeeping were top notch as well.The second floor lounge was a stand out. We spent a lot of time here for a quick mid-day break or at the end of our days decompressing. They serve a very nice continental breakfast of hard-boiled eggs, pastries, bagels, toast, oatmeal, cereal and yogurt with juice, tea and several types of coffee. They keep the area open all day and have energy bars, chips, water, soda, tea, hot cocoa and coffee. There is a lot of cozy areas to eat and never was completely full.The hotel is Moroccan themed but not overly so. The room was a nice size for our family of five as we had two full beds and a pull out sofa. The beds/sheets were comfortable and everything was very clean. The sofa bed was not quite as comfortable but my teenager had no issues on it. There was a privacy door to separate the two rooms. The shower had good water pressure and we just cracked a window to get rid of the steam.The location is really prime as it was only 1 block off of Times Square where you will find a lot of action, theatres and restaurants but also the hub for many subway lines. It is exciting and loud but surprisingly the hotel was very quiet only a few steps away. We treated it like an oasis to recharge with a midday power nap or a relaxing way to review a fun, busy day in NYC.The Casablanca is moderately priced but everything in NYC is relatively expensive. Looking back we felt that it was one of the highlights of our trip, gave us the best service (compared to the airlines, restaurants, etc) and was perfect for our needs. Therefore it was a good value and we will be back.",positive
Casablanca Hotel By Library Hotel Collection,1,7,,"A gem of a boutique hotel just a few steps to Times Square.The carpets in the bedrooms could do with an upgrade,and the our conditioner was rather noisy.There are no fridges in the rooms but they will bring ice if you request it.There are free toiletries provided with a hairdryer ,ironing board and iron.The beds and pillows were very comfortable and there were plenty of fluffy towels.There are free soft drinks and water provided all day with tea and coffee,fruit snack bars and crisps, in the second flour lounge , but the hotel does not have a licence to sell alcohol.This is all included in the resort fee with a continental breakfast.with yoghurt tea and coffee.There are  hardboiled eggs for breakfast, the staff will heat oatmeal porridge for you and toast bagels with cream cheese.We found this breakfast perfectly adequate and there are diners nearby if a full breakfast is required.All the staff are so very pleasant,friendly and welcoming, and will do everything to help you.We really enjoyed our stay and would stay at the Casablanca again if we visited New York.",positive
Casablanca Hotel By Library Hotel Collection,1,8,,"I almost always stay at the Casablanca when I'm in New York unless I'm at its sister hotel, The Library Hotel. It's location near Times Square is great. I go to a lot of theater and really appreciate the convenience of getting to all the theaters easily as well as walking back to the hotel late at night with no worries. Its midtown location is also perfect for getting to lots of other NYC destinations.  The hotel itself is like a small oasis, so tranquil and calm - you wouldn't guess the buzz of Times Square was just around the corner. The staff is terrific, courteous, helpful, friendly. That includes the front desk, the front door, and the staff of Rick's Cafe - the 2nd floor lounge. That lounge is quite a bonus - a very inviting space for complimentary breakfast, all day snacks, a bit of conversation with a pretty international group of visitors, and sometimes a space to do some work. The rooms are on the small side but I actually prefer a small hotel, especially when I have somewhere like the lounge to spread out if I need to work. And I appreciate the generosity of the refreshments.I want to mention Tony's, the restaurant next door that I believe is part of the same management. Tony's is a lively, busy, well priced Italian place but for me its best feature is the bar. I'm often hurrying to the theater for an early curtain or coming in for a meal after a play. I love the convenience of the location with its connecting door to the hotel (as well as the more used door to the street) as well as its informality. I also love that there is always a place for me at the bar and the kindness and great service of the two bartenders, Carlos and Ben.",positive
Casablanca Hotel By Library Hotel Collection,1,9,,"Fabulous hotel situated less than a minute from Times Square, when you enter the hotel a tranquil oasis awaits. Staff were all amazing and friendly from all the front of house including James & Dimitri, to the 2 lovely ladies serving breakfast and the cleaner's. We stayed in a petite queen room on the 4th floor, it was quiet and peaceful with the comfiest of pillows, bathrobes & slippers. Rick's Lounge was a real bonus with access to tea, coffees, water, juice & snacks 24/7 and a lovely place just to chill. Hotel is close to the subway & within walking distance to all major attractions. If in doubt ask the front desk who are more than happy to help.",positive
Casablanca Hotel By Library Hotel Collection,1,10,,"My wife and I went to NYC a week ago for a couple of Broadway shows, some good dinners, etc.  Most of the properties in mid town were looking to charge $600+ per night.  I stumbled across Casablanca Hotel on W 43rd ST on the internet, saw some positive reviews and decided to give it a shot.  We were really glad we did.  The room was a little small, but it's Manhattan.  It was clean, well stocked and properly serviced on a daily basis.  The front desk staff and doormen were always pleasant and conversational.  And the rate per night was extremely reasonable.It's *really* close to Times Square, which was a little concerning, but it wasn't a problem.  We were on the 5th floor of the hotel and couldn't hear any street noise.  We also loved the second floor lounge where a light, continental breakfast was served in the morning and fruit, water, sodas, etc. were available 24/7.  We will definitely return on our next trip and we were told upon checkout that we now qualify of the ""friends and family"" discount when we return.Great property!!",positive
Casablanca Hotel By Library Hotel Collection,2,11,,"This was my first extended hotel stay for a vacation. 5 days, 4 nights. This hotel was fantastic. It's QUIET (these smaller rooms don't offer a view, which they state on their site, but unless a cop car was on alert, I didn't hear any outside noise in my entire stay), quaint, classy, convenient, and economical: You don't spend too long in spots you don't want to be, nor does it take longer than you'd like to get where you need to go. There's a simple but spacious cafe that takes up all but one computer room on the second floor to get all-day snacks and beverages, and it's only a few steps to get to the lobby, so it's great to either walk up quickly to get something or stop there for a coffee and finish going downstairs.I got a petite queen room, and for a bigger, taller guy like myself, I was more than impressed with how much room I had for the price regarding the bathroom, closet, doorway, and central space (though the space to sit on the toilet is extremely tight, so fair warning there.) While I didn't spend much daytime in the room, if I had experienced a day where I would have been too exhausted to do anything and just wanted to stay in, the room was nice enough to validate doing so. I can imagine a couple making a room like this also work for a short stay.The concierges were all very cordial and helpful. The only time I had an issue was when the base of the shower head was leaking when showering, which they promptly fixed (it's also a very nice shower, too.)You're also right in Times Square, Broadway, 7th Avenue, and walking distance from stuff like the Rockefeller Center, with ample access to transit.",positive
Casablanca Hotel By Library Hotel Collection,2,12,,"Yup, all the positive reviews about this hotel are true.  LolMy sister and I spent 3 nights in the Casablanca hotel.  From the moment we entered to the moment we left, every employee that we encountered was kind, helpful and courteous.  The staff genuinely seemed to care about their guests and went out of their way to answer any questions we had.When we asked about taking the subway to Brooklyn, the kind employee (I'm sorry, I don't remember his name, but he was at the front desk on Thursday evening) took out a map, circled the correct subway station for us and wrote down which trains to take.  The ladies at the 2nd floor cafe were always helpful and they had such a positive attitude too.We had originally booked our stay for 2 nights but due to an unexpected change in our plans, we needed to extend our stay by one more night.  The front desk was quickly able to accommodate us and luckily we didn't have to switch rooms for that last night.   The room was clean and had everything we needed to enjoy our stay.The location is right by Times Square, within walking distance to many theater shows and restaurants, and it's a great base to explore the rest of the city, especially if this is your first time there.Kudos not just to the wonderful and professional staff, but to the management that hires them as well.  For this reason, we will be happy to come back and visit the Casablanca Hotel and highly recommend it to other people visiting NYC.For good cheap eats nearby I recommend:Joe's Pizza on Broadway:  I had the Caprese and Cheese slicesLos Tacos No.1-:  I had the adobada taco (yum!)  and the asada taco (I liked the adobada taco better)Both of these places had long lines, but they moved very quickly.  I think we waited in line about 15-20 minutes in each place.",positive
Casablanca Hotel By Library Hotel Collection,2,13,,"While I have stayed at The Casablanca many times over the last several years, this was my first trip since COVID. Therefore I was curious to see what changes, if any, had been made hoping that the hotel still had the same amenities as pre-COVID. Sadly, it does not. I guess the good news is that at least the hotel is open and you cannot say that for every business. But while The Casablanca remains a charming, small, hotel with an ideal location and friendly employees, sadly it lacks many of the things that formerly made it one of the best. For example, Rick's Cafe on the second floor offers an ideal respite from the hustle bustle of the city and a great place to crash after a busy day. Its daily Continental Breakfast offering, however, has been scaled back to what is now described as ""light"" and its nightly wine and cheese reception with weekly piano entertainment  (a great time and place to socialize and make new friends) has been eliminated altogether. I am not sure how much of this is due to staffing, supply, sanitary, and budgetary issues, but the hotel is now charging a daily Resort Fee that one would assume would cover such ""extras"". Alas, it does not. While the hotel does not have an on-site workout space, it previously had a trade with a local, nearby health club where a guest could go at no extra charge. During my recent stay that amenity was not being offered. When I checked in, the person at the Front Desk knew nothing of the prior arrangement. It was only later in the day, when I spoke with someone else, that I learned the health club had closed and that, as a result, the hotel no longer offered this guest service  as a part of a stay. The hotel has nicely appointed rooms with comfortable beds and nice bathrooms with daily housekeeping offered,  Something that, sadly, you no longer find at many other hotels.  Be sure to request an interior room as they are generally quieter.  All in all, I enjoyed my stay at The Casablanca, but the hotel ain't what it used to be. Then again, what is???",positive
Casablanca Hotel By Library Hotel Collection,2,14,,"I loved my 2 night stay at the Casablanca! It was quiet, clean and SO close to theater and any subway station you need to get around the city. I took the bus down and the Transit Authority station was only two blocks from the hotel, so it is a super convenient location. Every staff member I encountered was friendly and helpful. The bathroom must have been recently re-tiled because the shower tile was gorgeous, and  sparkling clean. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. The (free) breakfast buffet was simple, but perfect (bagels, pastries, fruit, cereal, EXCELLENT coffee), served from 7:30-11 every day, so you could roll down whenever. The common area where they serve breakfast is a lovely place to hang out at any time of day. My only complaint would be that my room was very cold (I would guess 60-65 degrees F), and the remote thermostat did nothing to change it. I prefer a chilly room when sleeping, and I was mostly sleeping while in my room, so it wasn't that bad, but noticeable. I did mention this to staff when checking out, and they told me the radiator heat can be a little chilly (to be fair, it was an extremely cold week), but I think someone older with less tolerance for cold may have been unhappy. I visit NYC regularly, and definitely will stay here again!",positive
Casablanca Hotel By Library Hotel Collection,2,15,,"We have been here several times before , it has a great location for exploring Tines Square or going to the Theatre , breakfast buffet which is rare in NYC  and complimentary tea, coffee etc throughout the day and night  which is also rare ! The team looked after us very well and nothing g us too much trouble . We booked a Junior Suite this time to give us more space and it was perfect !The only thing that’s changed is they no longer offer cheese & wine each evening , this was lovely touch  and we along with several other guests were disappointed that this is no longer offered",positive
Casablanca Hotel By Library Hotel Collection,2,16,,"This was the second stop on our anniversary trip and we only stayed 1 night but it was great. The room, lobby and lounge are very clean and the decor is great! We’ve stayed at other boutique hotels in NYC, but this is now our favorite, and although the room would be considered small when compared to larger chain hotels, ours was very comfortable for a boutique with a small table and 2 chairs plus closet area. We also had an interior room, 505 I believe, and we were surprised at how quiet it was for being in the city. Although there is no valet, a parking garage is very close and the rate for overnight is low for the city. Easy walking distance to Times Square, and Tony’s di Napoli has excellent Italian food and is literally right beside the hotel. All the staff we interacted with were friendly and helpful, and our bags were taken to our room so quickly that I didn’t realize I should have tipped the guy when he took them because we never saw him again but our bags were waiting in our room when we got there. An absolutely terrific experience and we’ll be sure to stay again when we do future overnights in the city.",positive
Casablanca Hotel By Library Hotel Collection,2,17,,"After a lot of research we booked a 5 night stay at this hotel with 4 other couples from England to celebrate a significant birthday.  From the moment we arrived we were met with some of the most friendly and helpful concierge staff we have ever come across.  They gave such great advice and helped with requests.  Whilst our room only had a view into a central courtyard it was clean and quiet.  The bathroom was wonderful and with complimentary shower and shampoo samples.  The maid who cleaned our room was incredible and it truly felt like a new stay every day.  Free water in the room and a good sized safe also helped.Apart from being so close to Times Square (although once inside the hotel you felt as if you were in your own world) the other selling point to us was the complimentary breakfast and drinks/snacks throughout the day in a large social area.  The breakfast staff couldn't do more to help with porridge orders, toast, pastries etc and you have help yourself coffee, tea, yoghurt, fruits etc.Our group of 10 all agreed we will return to New York and will only book this hotel again and we have been telling others about it too.  This is a real gem that is down to the staff employed there - Wonderful.",positive

Library is a great place to hang out on a  rainy or bitter cold  day outside. Rooms are well taken care of….no one knocking on your door in the morning to make up your room. But that room gets made up perfectly and daily!!!…would I go back to big hotels in NYC? You couldn't pay me!",positive
Casablanca Hotel By Library Hotel Collection,2,19,,"Our stay at this charming boutique hotel was as delightful as I remembered from past visits.  The entire staff were exceptional and treated both myself and my daughter with such thoughfulness after having our 6 day mother/daughter pre Christmas trip extended an additional 6 days due to flight cancellations.  Special thanks to John, General Manager who welcomed us back sans luggage after spending the better part of one day at the airport waiting to fly home only to be told our flight had been cancelled once again.Having stayed at the Casablanca in past years I did not consider staying anywhere else when planning this fun filled trip.  I was not disappointed.  Everything was as I remembered pre-pandemic with the light continental breakfast available each morning, snacks offered all day, comfortable rooms and cleanliness throughout.  Its central location right off Times Square is within walking distance to  restaurants, theatres, shopping, Bryant Park with its ice rink and Christmas Market, Rockefeller Centre and Central Park as well as many other walkable sights.  The welcoming staff when you return to the hotel made the day complete.Our unplanned Christmas day in New York City was exhilarating with it being spent amongst 1,000's of visitors like ourselves enjoying the joy and wonderment of this exciting, beautiful city at this special time of the year.

I needed a taxi and it arrived shortly after they called for one.I just can't say enough good things about this hotel.",positive
Casablanca Hotel By Library Hotel Collection,3,21,,"Spent three days at the Casablanca Hotel in NYC.  It is the perfect loaction if you are spending time in the theatre district/times square.  Sandwiched in between a wonderful diner (the Brooklyn Diner) and Tony's (very good Italian restaurant) - the Casablanca hotel is an oasis.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.  Our room was very large, comfortable and well appointed with a very large bathroom.  The decor was homey elegant and very ""Casablanca"".  The Breakfast Bar on the 2nd floor was open all day for all types of snacks and drinks (breakfast item are out from early morning until 10am).  Water, soda, juice, coffee, tea, cappucino, granola bars, fresh fruit, pastries, etc. are available all day (free of charge).  Breakfast hours included hard boiled eggs, bagels, toast, spreads, yougurts, cereals.... The room we had (404) had one king bed with comfortable bedding, ceiling fan, A/C unit, TV with over 300 channels, closet, hair dryer, safe and dresser.  No fridge or micro wave, though the staff would be able to heat up something if you asked (not really needed since the 2nd floor snack area had cold and hot drinks at the ready).  we had a wonderful stay and enjoyed walking across the street to the Sondheim thetre to see & Juliet and walking just a few blocks to the Lena Horne Theatre to see Six (both very good).

Casablanca Hotel By Library Hotel Collection,3,22,,"This weekend we flew to NYC and decided to stay near Times Square so we'd be close to the Broadway shows that we were planning on seeing.  We first saw the show, Harmony (created by Barry Manilow and Bruce Sussman), which was amazing and so heavy hitting to the current times we are living in.  Then the next night we saw, A Beautiful Noise (Neil Diamond story) and had another fun night that was uplifting with songs that you grew up with.  Our trip was based around these two shows so this hotel ended up being perfect.  Both theaters were within walking distance and literally three buildings down was Times Square.  We actually couldn't believe how quiet it was in our room at night time and how dark our room was so we were able to sleep peacefully.  Now if you like to sleep in, you might hear some of the people walking out of their rooms in the morning, but that is about it.  This is an older boutique hotel with some classic charm and a fabulous staff.  Their staff is very friendly, informative and just kind, which sometimes can be hard to find in NY.  The front desk staff are also the concierge so they are very informative and any of the doormen are willing to help you in any way they can.  On the second floor they have 24 hour coffee, bottle waters, chips and usually some granola bars of some sort.  This isn't fancy, but you won't find other hotels offering this stuff for free so it was great to grab a snack in the mornings before exploring all the nook and crannies that NYC has to offer.  Oh, also since it is the holidays, Bryant Park is right around the corner with all their holiday shops to do a little Christmas shopping.   Again, this is a great location and the place had character, would definitely stay here again.",positive

It was humid weekend so having working a/c was great.The room was dark, however. I guess older buildings are like that.Next time I stay, I will ask for a room with a window that faces the street instead of a building ( if there is such a thing in this hotel)I have stayed at the sister hotel, Hotel Elysee several times and that location is better for visiting the “Museum Mile”museumsAgain, as a solo traveler with ticket to an evening play, I wanted the security of a  lose walk back to my hotel",positive

I did my research before we booked this hotel, and it exceeded all my highest expectations. We loved the cozy, comfortable atmosphere and the beautiful Moroccan inspired decor. Our Premium Queen room was more spacious than the usual NYC hotel room, and the elegant black and white tile bathroom was beautiful. The part we loved most, though, was Rick's Cafe on the 2nd floor. It's like a comfy living room, with lots of tables, couches and chairs, a fireplace and free snacks, water, coffee, sparkling water, soft drinks, etc. all day.  You can hang out with a group of friends and not worry about the noise bothering other guests.Also, how many boutique hotels in NYC give you a lovely continental breakfast? We never imagined how many options there would be, and were very surprised to find anything we could possibly wish to eat. There were hard boiled eggs, oatmeal, (which they prepare for you), cereals, yogurt, sweet rolls, toast, bagels (which they happily toast for you), fresh fruit, three kinds of coffee, and more!  We will never think of staying anywhere else when we come to the city. We even met some nice people who have been coming there for over 16 years. That truly says something about a hotel. Everything in our room was immaculate, and the staff just couldn't do enough for us. I am going back there in March with some female relatives for a Girls Weekend theater trip, and I know my family members will be just thrilled with staying there!

It’s a great place to unwind after a busy day in the city.  The location can’t be beat  Broadway is maybe 100 ft away and the subway is not much farther.

The safe is located for someone who is 2 meters tall. There are details in the room to improve, such as the sheet with holes (see photo) or the bathroom door for sanding. The mattress is not firm. The outlet cover comes loose. But above all I don't put 5 stars beyond those details because the porter who was generally in the afternoon with long hair (I don't know the name) was a polite, you said ""hello, thank you"" and never answered and had the face of few friends... it was like it bothered him that he entered and left the hotel...

We had 24-hour access to the cafe/lounge.  It was very cozy and we would have enjoyed the patio if the weather had been milder.  Our room (501) was quiet and the bed was very comfortable.  We couldn't have asked for better service from the cafe and housekeeping staff.  We stayed on the fifth floor and typically took the stairs.  The elevators are fairly small so this might not be the best place to stay if you have mobility issues and use a wheelchair.

Breakfast, while not extravagant, is very good, and includes not only pastries, bagels, fruit and yogurt but also hard-boiled eggs and oatmeal, as well as a machine for cappuccino, latte, etc. The location can't be beat -- a stone's throw from Bryant Park and a quick walk to Times Square. My only complaint is that the rooms are dark and cave-like, with window air conditioners. (At least the 2 rooms I've seen are like that -- perhaps others are different.) But the beds are very comfortable, the toiletries high-end, and Rick's is always open if you prefer to sit and read or relax in a brighter, more open environment. Will definitely return.",positive

Brian was brilliant, he communicated with us throughout the process of arranging alternative rooms for our party (2 adults, 2 older teenagers).The hotel prides itself on customer service and this was apparent throughout our stay, everyone was polite, friendly and eager to help us on our first trip to NY.The hotel is in an excellent location just off times square.

Casablanca Hotel By Library Hotel Collection,4,34,,"My family stayed here during a Spring Break trip, and we loved it. My wife and I stayed at Hotel Elysee many years ago, so we were familiar with the collection. More than a decade later, they still live up to the high ratings that each hotel maintains.My kids loved the lounge (especially my daughter who loves cats and enjoyed the numerous cat statues throughout) including the games and piano. Breakfast was nice - it's continental but great for a light start to the day - and being able to grab a snack or drink throughout the day was great.The staff were all extremely welcoming and helpful. At breakfast, the helped us navigate what options were safe for our son (dairy allergy) and offered to toast our bagels daily. Everyone at the front desk was very friendly. It rained several days we were there and, while we were prepared with our own umbrellas, front desk staff always offered one of theirs.We stayed in the suite so we'd have a little more space and I was very glad we did. Having the extra room made it feel much more comfortable than a standard room in Manhattan. Location is also outstanding if you plan to spend a lot of time in and around Times Square.We only had two very minor complaints:  1. The shower curtain was very short and difficult to keep in the tub so the floor got a bit wet during showers. 2. Being an older building, the heat is provided by radiator which made the room extremely warm at times. We simply opened the windows and had the fan/AC run a bit to cool it down.Overall, I can't recommend this place enough.",positive

Casablanca Hotel By Library Hotel Collection,4,40,,"What makes the Casablanca our go to hotel in Manhattan? Charm, location, amenities, comfort, friendliness and service!I first came to the Casablanca hotel about 30 years ago on a business  trip with 4 other people. The hotel made such a great impression on the group that I’ve continued to return for both work and pleasure trips multiple times since then. The most recent visit with my husband for a week in May 2024. Everyone is friendly and eager to help out. The staff at Ricky’s Cafe can’t be beat. Ricky’s is a lovely lounge with tables, chairs and sofas that serves a very nice basic buffet breakfast with bagels, very good pastries (croissants are delicious), cereals,  oatmeal, hard boiled eggs, fruit and other. The staff at the cafe are so helpful and toast bread and bagels, cut up fruit or make bowls  of oatmeal with fruit and deliver it to your seat. Each are charming and so helpful.  After breakfast  It’s a lovely place to read or visit with friends.  There are free beverages and snacks as well. There’s also an outdoor seating area in nice weather.I would call the hotel European style. It’s old and rooms are smallish but very comfortable. My husband and I stayed in a suite for our most recent trip and enjoyed the extra space for a week long trip. It’s definitely a noisy area and we used the air conditioners as white noise which helped. Our room had shades and blinds so it was nice and dark at night - and during the day if needed for a nap.We pretty much walked everywhere, but the subway and Grand Central Station are close and make getting around very convenient. The front desk staff are always ready to help out with suggestions and directions when needed. Thank you to everyone answering we will definitely continue to stay for our NY trips.",positive

The entire second floor is a lounge area ideal for visiting with friends, eating take out, etc. This is also where they serve their light breakfast, which is very good and ample for getting you started on your NYC day. Great coffee! (The lounge does get crowded at peak breakfast hours. The servers do an excellent job of keeping things moving.) We had two issues this trip (clogged toilet & middle of the night smoke alarm battery warning). Both were handled immediately by personnel who were skilled and professional. Also, my husband got a stomach bug while we were there, and the staff helped us with this in a caring and professional manner. We'll be back!",positive

We had all we needed (e.g., small table, 2 chairs, dresser, night tables with lamps, and a closet), and slept well all 4 nights.

It is an older hotel that could possibly use some 'refreshing', but we are still very happy to stay there each time we visit Broadway.  The theater district and Times Square are so close by, making this an incredibly convenient place to stay.

Casablanca Hotel By Library Hotel Collection,5,48,,"We’ve stayed at the Casablanca twice in recent months and will gladly return on subsequent New York visits. We initially chose it for its midtown location and short walk to the set of subway lines at the southern end of Times Square.  When we stay in New York, we rely on the subways and these take us with minimal transfers most anywhere on the East or West side. Our only concern when first reserving was noise, but the hotel is unaccountably quiet. We stayed both times in a deluxe queen room, which has a comfortable bed but characteristically for New York is not large.  Given the small rooms, what sets the hotel apart is the second floor space they call Rick’s Cafe that is used for the continental breakfast, but serves us during the day like a large living room complete with coffee and snacks. If we need a break, that’s where we head.Hotel staff deserve applause. Whether front desk, providing breakfast service, or housekeeping, staff have been extraordinarily responsive and in unfailing good humor. Casablanca’s combination of staff, location, and facilities will keep us coming back.",positive

We even had a celebratory bottle of wine from the team in our room on arrival which was so thoughtful.Breakfast was brilliant  - loads of choice (loved the bagels with everything!), great coffee (especially the hazelnut!) and drinks and the breakfast room staff were so friendly. Felt like a real home from home to be able to visit the lounge in dressing gown/slippers first thing in the morning and grab a coffee to take back to bed and plan the day!24 hour snacks snd drinks were a great touch. Was so lovely to be able to come back from a full day out and relax/recharge in the comfortable lounge, filled with great snacks and drinks, before heading out again. The hotel isn’t huge, so the lounge area had a lovely friendly feel and it was nice to meet other guests and feel the opposite of a corporate or big chain hotel.Staff were so friendly and nothing was too much bother for them.

Large bathroom also equipped with bathrobes, slippers and quality Italian bath products, regularly exchanged. Excellent overall levels of cleanliness. Given the prohibitive prices of bars and bakeries in NYC I recommend opting for the formula with breakfast that has proved more than satisfactory for both the sweet and savory. In pointing out that the price paid was not exactly cheap but in line with facilities of a similar category in the area, especially during the Christmas period, I can only reiterate the excellent choice of this structure.",positive
"Luma Hotel Times SquareIf you own this business, claim it for free now to update business info, respond to reviews, and more.Claim this listing",1,3,,"Our experience of the Luma was positive overall with some caveats.As other reviewers have said, the location is hard to beat. It’s convenient for lots of the main attractions and subway stations and an oasis of calm despite being so close to Times Square.The rooms are comfy, clean and quiet (we were in an urban room on an upper floor) with good quality bedding, towels and toiletries. The in-room Nespresso machine was great for an early morning coffee. I shared a queen twin room with my teenage son. It was a good size for two by NY standards but imagine it could be snug for four due to the limited storage.Reception and door staff were uniformly friendly and helpful. Staff at breakfast, less so. Some were friendly but others were unsmiling and unhelpful. I am lactose-intolerant and despite having registered this prior to arrival (at the hotel’s request), it hadn’t been noted. On the first morning at breakfast, there was no allergen labelling on any of the dishes, so I asked one of the wait staff if any of the baked items were dairy-free, she simply said ‘No, they all have dairy’ and walked away. No attempt to suggest or offer alternatives. The scrambled eggs and frittata (which are offered on alternative days) also had dairy.The breakfast choice was therefore very limited for anyone who is lactose-intolerant or vegan and generally very carb- and sugar-heavy. Some elements (juice from concentrate, industrial coffee from large urns, inferior sausages) felt more budget hotel than four star. And the fact that the fruit salad and granola pots were all in individual plastic containers was at odds with the environmental messaging elsewhere.Most days we were seated fairly quickly but as the breakfast room is small (only a dozen or so tables), there can be bottlenecks. One morning we waited 25 mins, then had to rush breakfast as we had timed tickets for an attraction. This set-up seemed rather amateurish for a four-star hotel.The lobby is tiny and showing signs of wear and tear (tables broken and chipped, leatherette seats a bit worn and shabby). We didn’t use the bar area as were out every night but there seemed to be a lively, fun atmosphere any time we passed through.Overall, I would recommend the Luma on location and bedrooms but its breakfast offering and inconsistent service would benefit from some work. We booked during the Black Friday sale and got a 30% discount on the room but even at $500 rather than $700 a night, I would have expected more from a four-star hotel.",positive

The location is therefore ideal for people wanting to be in the center of NYC, close to the subway, Grand Central Station, departures for the Hop On Hop Off buses, Port Autorithy, etc. The entire staff is friendly, available, and the doormen screen the customers well. The cleaning staff are discreet and efficient. The breakfast is OK, with fresh fruit, but you shouldn't expect a European-style breakfast (we're staying in the USA, the food being historically English...).Of course, on the 10th floor you can hear 41st Street, but it's acceptable for Manhattan (ear plugs are still strongly recommended for people sensitive to noise at night).THE bathroom is very modern. functional, clean, with popular Etro bath products.However, the floor mats in the rooms, impossible to clean properly, do not allow you to walk without indoor slippers. The bedroom door is very noisy to close (be careful to make sure it is closed despite the noise!).That the cappuccino for breakfast is an extra charged extra is a little petty given the price of the hotel (especially since there is a machine for it and the boss is Italian, mama mia.!).The hotel restaurant is really not great for an Italian (the Arancini stuffed with tasteless cheese leaves you wondering, probably to the taste of Americans, but far from the Italian recipe). No better or worse than most restaurants in Manhattan.In the end, the establishment remains an excellent quality and recommendable hotel for enjoying the center of Manhattan.",positive

Also tried the restaurant which, despite being a little expensive but in line with NY prices, offers translated menus and excellent dishes. Finally, the price, although not exactly cheap, does not hide other costs, neither tourist taxes nor resort fees which weigh heavily at the end of the stay. If we really want to find a flaw, the breakfast, despite being of good quality, is not very varied and in the long run a little tired also because the black lady who serves it certainly doesn't have the friendliness of her colleagues!

The room we booked was more than spatious enough for the two of us, and we each had a queen size bed. The reusable complementary bottle of water with the Luma logo was a nice detail. The hotel has happy hour between 4-6pm each day, during which you can order selected alcoholic drinks and snacks at a fair price. And all tasted very well.

If you are looking to see the city,  just be aware of your room type/selection. We only were in there long enough to sleep and recharge, so the view wasn't important to us.Shower pressure was good, sink water was cloudy but I think that's just the city. Rooms have doorbells and they provide robes, slippers, hair dryer, shampoo and conditioner that wasn't terrible. Little espresso machine, mini fridge, decent closet space and drawers under the bed as well. There is also a robot Alina that will bring you things you request like extra towels, etc.The price we found was great for 4 nights and it far exceeded our expectations. Definitely worth booking! Will consider again if we find ourselves back in the city!",positive

Don't expect a mega buffet but there was a bit of everything at a reasonable price for New York (25 dollars for adults and 15 for children + taxes).At dinner we tried both the pizza and the first courses. The first was very good, for the pasta...appreciated the effort but nothing more!Despite the proximity to the Times Square casino, the rooms were very well soundproofed and the beds very comfortable!!!",positive

Stayed there for ~10 days in mid-June 2022.  The dual king beds were AWESOME!  Hotel and rooms/bathrooms were clean.  Hotel staff was exceptional in providing additional linens and pillows as requested, not to mention super-fast delivery of anything we needed when called down to the front desk (like more Nespresso pods, creamer, sugar/splenda, etc).  We even needed to call one time to get the toliet unplugged (how embarrassing!) because my youngest put too much toliet paper in, but they came within minutes to take care of it for us!  We really liked the European style continental breakfast (was included with our room rate) which started each day off with plenty of energy to explore the city.  The hotel staff at front desk/door, and especially are appreciative to Jonathan who helped us checkin/out with bags as well as asked him for a few recommendations while we were there.  Room had no view, but that was great for us as the room was very quiet (no street noise) and we all slept wonderfully each night.  Location was superb, with Bryant Park right down the street, multiple subway lines entrances within 1 to 1 1/2 blocks, and of course Times Square right down the street as well.

There were four of us in a room, with breakfast included.The hotel has a small and probably not very visible entrance, and the room had a view of... a wall, as already described by others. We also noticed a small area, quite close to the hotel, where some homeless people are permanently stationed (unfortunately very common in New York, at least during the period of our trip).Having said that, however, as far as we are concerned the negative aspects stop here.The positive ones are many more:- the staff is very courteous and helpful: they responded promptly to all requests (including that of booking entrances to the zoo and aquarium for us), they were very kind in all situations, even in the contacts made during the phases booking; this was done directly with the hotel and allowed us to take advantage of a $75 discount voucher to use in their restaurant- the room, despite being rather small (but it seems to be normal in those parts) was new and functional, with a large bathroom and a very comfortable, clean and above all extremely quiet shower: it is true that we were on the 27th floor (with the cheaper rate...) but still we didn't feel anything about the chaos of the city- the location is excellent: 5 minutes walk from Times Square and 10-15 minutes walk from many of the attractions in the central area (Top of the Rock, Empire State Building, Central Park, MoMA, etc.); nearby there is a 24-hour supermarket and several restaurants (mostly fast food of various kinds)- breakfast is good and quite varied, although more concentrated on sweet food than on savory food; the room is quite small, but so is the hotel, so the two things compensate each other; only in a couple of cases did we have to wait 5-10 minutes to be seatedUltimately, it is a solution that we recommend to anyone who is in New York and wants to stay in the center.",positive

As we entered the room we were immediately drawn to the view.  We checked in between 2:30 and 3:00 pm (middle of the afternoon) yet the view out the window was so dark I was unable to tell if it was day or night. We appeared to be in some kind of court yard with other shared buildings. The only light  in this dank dark courtyard came from inside these other buildings meaning if I could clearly see into them anyone in these buildings could clearly see me too.As we were getting over the shock of terrible view we began to look for a light switch in the dark rooms. Unable to locate a wall switch that worked we were eventually able to find three small wall sconces the managed to shed enough light in our room for us to begin to put away our luggage in the cramped room.The bathroom had a sliding frosted plastic door that slammed everytime it was opened or closed.The queen beds and linens were comfortable and clean but as we got up we noticed that the AC in the room wasn’t working and the temperature was climbing in the room. We quickly brought this to the attention of the front desk and they sent someone up to fix it.Before leaving for the day I placed all the used towels on the floor and placed the card on the bed requesting the linens be changed. Later that evening when we returned we noticed the room hadn’t been touched. We were able to at least scrounge a few clean towels from the front desk for the evening. The next morning at approximately 830 AM house keeping woke us up asking if we wanted the room cleaned I explained we did and that we would be leaving shortly. Upon our return that afternoon  I noticed nothing had been cleaned again. Not wanting a repeat of the night before I was able to track down a house keeper and ask her to come when we left for the evening. This time someone finally came and cleaned.On our last evening there I used their expensive valet service ($100 a day and once it’s parked they ask you not to take it back out). As I was checking out they stated there was a $300 dollar balance on my room for the valet parking and asked how I wanted to pay for it? I had to explain that I had only used their inflated parking for 1 night before this was corrected. Over all I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to my worst enemy.,negative

We are very happy to have chosen him. I was worried about the noise from the hustle and bustle of the city, but we were surprised by a completely silent and peaceful room. We stayed on the back side of the building, very nice. The hotel is not one of those giants, it is cozy, well decorated, fast elevators, the room is comfortable, spacious bathroom, well finished, the shower is very nice and warm after a whole day walking around the city, it is very relaxing. All the staff served us very well, always polite and friendly. A special mention to Iris Cordero, who patiently answered all the questions I sent by email. A highlight also for the person who cleaned the room every day, and also for the person who left some delicious chocolate bars in the room every day, always smiling and in a good mood. We can see that the team is well prepared to perform their respective roles. The only negative point I considered was that the room, despite being very comfortable and pleasant, is too small for more than two people. If guests arrive with a lot of suitcases, it will be very cramped to move around the room. Other than that, this is a hotel that will remain a reference for future trips to New York and I will definitely recommend it to other people. I hope that the hotel always maintains this standard and continues to strive to improve even more. Note: We stayed in room 2805. There was a lot of dust on the wardrobe in this room, as if it hadn't been cleaned in a long time. The cleaning team could pay a little more attention to this aspect. For allergy sufferers, dust may be a problem during your stay. As a suggestion, the hotel could install toilet showers in the bathrooms.",positive

Our experience was very similar and this is still our favorite hotel! ""My husband called this “the perfect hotel room” and I couldn’t agree more! What a pleasure to have such thoughtful design: a coat rack, a closet with a light, drawers for clothing (some hotels don’t think you bring clothes), excellent lighting with a master switch, an espresso machine, enough plugs for your electronics, a freaking make-up mirror and sound machine!, fantastic layout for bathroom, with robes and slippers, and soft toilet paper! (ok, so the tissues could use upgrading). we had a skyline king with sofa, and although I was disappointed at first to be right next to the elevator-there was no noise from the machinery at all. And the service was as thoughtful as the design…we were waiting for an elevator, and the door opened..it was going up, not down, but the hotel employee said “ guests come first” and he switched the direction of the elevator, and let us go down to the lobby! I wish I had gotten his name, but his kind act created such goodwill! We loved the way to indicate you need housekeeping or wanted privacy. The fridge even was laid out better than normal fridges! There was a safe, large tv, electric blinds. We didn’t have breakfast, but I did peak at it, and it looked good. The free sangria was nice too!
